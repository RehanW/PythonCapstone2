# PythonCapstone2
A simple python game

This is a simple game created with pygame. It is a randomized game where the enemies cross the screen from right to left, spawning
at random locations and moving and random speeds. If the enemy touches the player the game is over or if the enemies catches the 
special item then the game is also over and the player loses. If the player gets the special item the game is over and the player wins.
If all of the enemies cross the screen and the player managed to avoid all of them the game is also over and the player winis.

This game is available for anyone with access to IDLE python to run the file.
